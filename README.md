# custom_enumerables
The Odin Project's Custom Enumerables

# Assignment
Rebuild some methods from the Enumerable module

# Goal
1. Create the functionality of the given methods without using the actual methods.
2. Make sure the methods pass the given tests.

# Expectations and challenges
1. It's going to be interesting to learn how to deal with blocks and so on.
2. I guess it's going to be a struggle. Not every method will be obvious and I don't expect to always find the most efficient way of coding it.

# Results and Evaluation
1. It took quite a bit of mental gymnastics and letting the concept settle in before it became kind of apparent how to deal with these assigments.
2. Once the basics were there, with a for loop and yielding whatever variables were needed, it all kind of ended up being quite obvious.
